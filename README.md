#working with sass

I was stated this project  for practice sass. 
So I created website with it. It's Sass official website clone. It has only "installing of sass" page only.
I did my best for that site. You can see live site on https://prasanna-indrajith.github.io 

I'm also working on other pages. There will be add to new branch soon.
